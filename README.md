Hi, My Name is Ashhar Shah,

I am a student at one of Pakistan's leading Computer Science and Engineering University (Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute) pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 😀

I love Cats and the color Blue. 😋

The language i am using for programming is C++, people might say its old but i like it because it adds flexibility when you move on to other languages. 
💻 

Currently I am in my 2nd Year in the university so i still have alot to learn. 😁
